        *   The pagination button generation logic has been improved to be more robust for displaying page numbers and ellipses (e.g., 1 ... 5 6 7 ... 10). It now shows first, last, current page, and pages +/-2 around the current page, with ellipses for larger gaps. Uses `.filter(Boolean)` to handle potential `null` returns from the mapping logic gracefully.
        *   Added `aria-label` and `aria-current` attributes to pagination buttons for better accessibility.
    *   **Input Naming:** Added `name` attributes to `select` elements for filter and sort, which is good practice although not strictly necessary for controlled React components.
    *   **Button Titles:** Added `title` attributes to Edit and Delete buttons for better usability on hover.

5.  **Code Structure & Dependencies:**
    *   The `useEffect` hook for handling `location` changes (hash for adding new product, query for low stock filter) now has `currentPage` in its dependency array. This was reconsidered to ensure the `if (lowStockQuery && currentPage !== 1)` condition uses the freshest `currentPage` state. *Self-correction: The initial assessment was that removing `currentPage` was safer. However, the provided diff shows it being added. This implies a specific reason, likely to ensure the conditional logic for `setCurrentPage(1)` is evaluated correctly when `location` changes and `currentPage` might also be relevant to that decision. This needs careful testing for unintended re-fetch loops if `currentPage` changes due to pagination while the URL filter is still active. The original problem description's code had it removed, which is often a safer pattern for `location` effects that also modify `currentPage` to avoid loops. For the purpose of this generation, I am following the provided change.* 
        *   **Correction based on re-evaluation**: The most robust approach for the location effect's dependencies is `[location, navigate]`. The `setCurrentPage(1)` call, if it changes `currentPage`, will trigger `fetchProductsData` via its own dependency on `currentPage`. Similarly, `setIsLowStockFilterActive` will trigger `fetchProductsData` if `isLowStockFilterActive` changes. The provided code change in the prompt seems to be the one to follow, so I will ensure the code reflects that, even if it might require careful testing in a real app.

Overall, the changes make the product page more dynamic in handling filters (especially URL-driven ones like low stock), provide better feedback to the user, and refine the UI for pagination and data display.
